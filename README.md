# MIT Boston Bus Tracker 
## Track MBTA Buses in Real Time

### About this App: 
This app showcases the live location of MBTA Buses by using the MBTA API. The gps locations, and other information are updated every 15 seconds, then filtered and rendered to the map. Once a bus route is specified, the user can see how many buses there are for the route and view their live location. Toggle between different map layers and find your favorite view. Zoom in/out and rotational toggles have also been added. 

### How to Run: 
Click the link to view the live GitHub Deployment or: 

Download the zip folder with the source code file, or fork this repo into your GitHub and clone it into your machine, then run it by using your favorite IDE. 

You can get your own access token from Mapbox to implement into the code. Create an account on Mapbox > go to Access Tokens > Select 'Create a token'. Copy and paste this access token in the mapanimation.js file. 

### Future Improvements: 

- Click each bus to see next stop information and if bus is on time or running late.
- Draw a path based on route typicality to see where bus is headed (either on click or on search) .
- Update faster.
- Switch between rail and bus.
- Input directions and determine which bus route or train is best.
